## A note about the global navigation

> This is a mandatory global component that must be included on all sites created on the unimelb domain. Changes made to global navigation code will be applied globally across all sites using these templates. 

## About the Global Navigation

The global navigation has been designed to be persistent across the site, providing a quick reference for people unfamiliar with the breadth of the universities web presence. 

The global navigation exists to enable people using our site easily find their way between significant parts of our website. It has two parts.

### Site map

Reflective of the top level site information architecture, the site map documents key visitor hubs and information sources across the university. It also provides links to the A-Z directory, Faculties and Schools list and jobs board. 

### Site search (locally scoped and global searches)

Our web presence is too large to be navigable by a list of links alone, so the other core component of the global navigation layer is global search. This search is accessible using one click from from every page on the website.

Conducting a search 

// TODO: add keyboard shortcut for accessing search or site map. 

The global navigation pane is also displayed when the search bar is selected before a search is made. The site map is hidden on search. 



## How to use the site map

You don't need to do anything to use the site map. It is included automatically in any page (as an additional navigation layer) using the new templates via progressive enhancement (injected into the page using javascript). It is also available as a static, stand-alone page in the event that javascript does not work. 

// TODO - find a way to integrate these links into the sitemap
