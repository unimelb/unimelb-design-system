      Environmental scientist Tim Flannery joins University of Melbourne
    </h1>
    <p>
      One of Australia’s most highly regarded environmental scientists, Professor Tim Flannery, will join the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute as a Professorial Fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Flannery said he was delighted to join the University in this role where he could further contribute to research and engagement on issues of sustainability and climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing human beings on the planet. I’m pleased to take up the appointment to continue to push frontiers and move forward in dealing with climate change,” said Professor Flannery.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The research I am planning to undertake at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute will focus on what is needed to renew and replenish the Earth’s ecosystem,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Brendan Gleeson, Director of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, said Professor Flannery’s appointment was an outstanding addition to the University community.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Professor Flannery’s scientific and policy work on sustainability is world class. He is an invaluable source of clear ideas on how we can change direction before it’s too late. We are incredibly pleased to have him on board,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Flannery was named Australian of the Year in 2007 for his work on population levels and carbon emissions and was also Chairman of the Copenhagen Climate Council, an international climate change awareness group.

      University of Melbourne announces new Asian Exchange scholarship
    </h1>
    <p>
      The University of Melbourne has partnered with the <a href="https://info.westpac.com.au/200years/?wbc-vnty=www.westpac.com.au/200years">Westpac Bicentennial Foundation</a> and the University of Sydney in the launch of the inaugural Asian Exchange scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valued at $10,000 the <a href="https://studenteforms.app.unimelb.edu.au/apex/f?p=153:2:0:::2:P2_ID:781">Asian Exchange scholarship</a> offers second year students enrolled full-time in an undergraduate degree the opportunity to study for one semester at a leading Asian university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exchanges will be available with the following University of Melbourne partner universities:
    </p>
    <ul class="ticked-list">
      <li>
        Beijing: Tsinghua University and Peking University
      </li>
      <li>
        Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong
      </li>
      <li>
        Shanghai:  Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University
      </li>
      <li>
        Singapore: National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Professor Susan Elliott, Deputy Vice-Chancellor International at the University of Melbourne said the scholarship provides a fantastic opportunity for University of Melbourne students to engage with Asia, to grow in their cultural knowledge of this exciting region and to develop future connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are delighted to be a partner with Westpac on this wonderful initiative,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Asian Exchange scholarship is one of three scholarships established by the Westpac Bicentennial Foundation in partnership with the University of Melbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students who receive a scholarship will be able to ‘build their own adventure’ and individualise their Asian exchange to include experiences such as an intensive language course, an internship or volunteering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise of Asia presents a unique opportunity for Australia.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        60% of the world’s population lives in Asia.
      </li>
      <li>
        By 2025, four of the 10 largest economies in the world will be in Asia.
      </li>
      <li>
        Asian economies are expected to account for almost 50% of global economic output by 2025.
      </li>
      <li>
        Middle class consumers in Asia will increase by 2.5 billion and account for 60% of total global middle class consumption by 2030[1].
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With the rapid growth in economic power and influence in our region, Australia is well placed to contribute to, and benefit from, the growth opportunities right on our doorstep. A greater understanding of Asian culture, markets and languages will be vital to build stronger business and cultural connections across the region. The Asian Exchange scholarships will help underpin these efforts by supporting ambitious students keen to contribute to Australia’s success in Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Westpac Bicentennial Foundation CEO Susan Bannigan said, “We will need future leaders with deep connections across Asia.  These scholarships offer a great springboard for young people to start building those connections now.  We hope to inspire students to immerse themselves in this really exciting and dynamic growth area.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’re delighted to partner with Westpac to offer students an opportunity to become truly global citizens. We are now well and truly in the midst of the Asian Century, and we’re proud to join Westpac to help students become some of the nation’s most Asia-literate graduates. The hands-on experiences offered by the Asian Exchange scholarships will be invaluable for our promising students as they become tomorrow’s leaders,” said Dr Michael Spence, Vice-Chancellor of The University of Sydney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scholarship applications are now open at The University of Melbourne and the University of Sydney.

    <h1>
      Laws restricting use of the burqa are "ridiculous"
    </h1>
    <p>
      Public Policy Fellow Nicholas Reece thinks it is "absolutely ridiculous" to make laws telling people what they should and should not wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Reece thinks the debate is divisive and he has seen no evidence that the burqa is a security risk in Australia.
    </p>
